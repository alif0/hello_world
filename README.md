0. Install GIT and what is GIT


1. Install Python & what is Python

  1.1 Install Anaconda and related packages
  
  1.2 Python Interpreter (program/virtual machine that takes your program and runs it for you - translating commands into a language the OS understands)
  
  1.3 Running a program (shell or execute it)
  
  1.4 Compliled program vs interpreted program - 
  	C, C# - need to compile the code, creates object file, need to link the code, creates a binary file that you then run directly on the OS
  	Java - need compiles to byte code that runs on the jvm.
  	python, perl, ruby - scripting language - no need to compile, need an interpreter to run.
